# Introduction

Since their inception, warplanes have been a defining force in military history, shaping the way nations engage in warfare and secure their borders. Emerging during World War I, these aircraft quickly evolved from simple reconnaissance tools to critical instruments of combat. From agile fighter jets dominating the skies to bomber planes delivering devastating strikes, warplanes have played an integral role in both offensive and defensive military strategies.

Technological advancements have driven the evolution of warplanes, transforming them into some of the most sophisticated machines ever created. The speed, maneuverability, and firepower of fighter jets like the F-22 Raptor and the Eurofighter Typhoon exemplify the cutting edge of aeronautical engineering. Meanwhile, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and stealth bombers like the B-2 Spirit highlight the growing emphasis on precision and survivability in modern warfare. Each class of warplane serves a unique purpose, from air superiority missions to ground support and intelligence gathering.
