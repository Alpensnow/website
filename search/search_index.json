At the outbreak of the war, airplanes were a novel invention, and were primarily used for reconnaissance and gathering intelligence on enemy positions. However, as the conflict progressed, warplanes quickly evolved into critical tools for combat. As pilots began mounting machine guns on their airframes and hand-dropping explosives on enemy combatants below, dogfights and bombing runs became defining features of the air war, adding a new dimension to the battlefield. These early planes were marvels of ingenuity, crafted from wood and fabric but equipped with cutting-edge technologies of their time, such as synchronized machine guns that could fire through the propeller arc. Despite their simplicity by modern standards, these aircraft set the foundation for the warplanes that followed. United Kingdom In 1912, the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) was founded with a military and naval wing, along with a central flying school. The RFC's early years were spent testing aircraft for artillery spotting and aerial photography. At the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, the RFC comprised of only three squadrons with about 30 serviceable aircraft, but quickly expanded. The British aircraft industry, initially behind Germany and France in design and production, rapidly caught up and produced some of the most iconic planes of the conflict.
